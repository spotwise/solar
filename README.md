# Solar

A Swift package that calculates the time of sunrise and sunset for a
given location and date. 

This package includes two different algorithms of calculating the sunrise
and sunset.

One alternative is based on the Corrected Sunrise, Sunset, Noon Times in 
Seconds - and Solar Angles Matlab function developed by Richard Droste, 
that was created based on the spreadsheets available in the Earth System 
Research Laboratory website from the National Oceanic & Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA).

The second alternative uses the Sunrise equation as described on Wikipedia,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunrise_equation.

Please note: No guarantee is provided that the calculations are correct.
